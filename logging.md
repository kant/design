# Logging

The logging strategy for app navigator is twofold:

1. each component writes "types" of log entries to stdout 
1. the kappnav CR provides a user external to control the log level

## Logging by Programming Language 

1. [Java](https://github.com/kappnav/design/blob/master/javalogging.md)
1. [Golang](https://github.com/kappnav/design/blob/master/gologging.md)
