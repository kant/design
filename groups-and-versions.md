The [Kubernetes Applications SIG](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application) defines the Application CRD for defining Kubernetes applications consisting of multiple resources, known as components. The specification defines a spec field `componentKinds` which is an array of the components of an application. ```yaml spec: componentKinds: - group: core kind: Service - group: apps kind: Deployment ``` Only `group` and `kind` are currently defined for an application component. <br/><br/> **Invalid group names and backward compatibility** Initial implementations of Application Navigator allowed invalid values to be specified for group which could cause errors when multiple CRDs have the same kind but different groups.

These core builtin kinds have a blank/empty group internally. ```yaml - group: core kind: Service ``` <br/> **Versions** The version for each group/kind will be the preferred version for the group, as determined by Kubernetes discovery, since the spec does not provide a way to specify version.
