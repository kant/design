# Extend KAM to Status Mappings and Detail Sections

The application and component status and UI detail sections are configured and managed by ConfigMaps. Their schemes of mapping resouce kind to status config maps or detail section config maps are mostly the same as the one for the KAM mapping scheme to map resource kind to action configmaps described in [Kind-Action Mapping](https://github.com/kappnav/design/blob/master/actions-config-maps.md) and with some differences, which are described in this document.
